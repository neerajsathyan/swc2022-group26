Software Cointainerization Project

## Flask Project
- Install all dependencies in a venv from requirements.txt
- run `start.py` which will start the Flask application with a static webpage showing results from `/web/default.py`
- The REST APIs are configured in `routes.py` that routes to `/apis/model.py` where you will have the *GET* and *POST* method.
- The APIS for now are `http://localhost:8000/api/swc` in GET and POST method. Try running it in postman. :)
- Thats all folks :)

## Frontend
- Change your terminal directory to `swc/frontend`
- Run the local network using command:
```
npm run serve
